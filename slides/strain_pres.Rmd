## Background

*  Limitations of previous metrics

  *  Sacks, hits, hurries
  
  *  Time in pocket (TIP)
  
  *   Pass rusher/blocker win rate (PRWR, PBWR)

---

## Motivation

How do we measure pass rusher effectiveness?

*   Distance to QB

*   Moving rate towards QB

*   How about both?

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_second

---

## Strain rate in materials science

*  Strain: deformation of a material from stress.

$$\displaystyle s(t)={\frac  {L(t)-L_{0}}{L_{0}}}$$

*  Strain rate

$${\displaystyle {{s}'}(t)={\frac {ds}{dt}} = {\frac {v(t)}{L_{0}}}}$$


$L(t)$: distance between two points of interest at time $t$

$L_0$: initial distance between those two points

$v(t)$: how fast two points of interest are moving away from/towards each other

---

## An analogy

* A pass-rusher tries to apply force/deformation against the offensive line with the ultimate goal of breaking through the protection to reach the QB. 

* Players = "particles" in some material

  *   The defensive "particles" are attempting to exert pressure on the pocket with the aim of compressing and collapsing this pocket around the QB.

## Application to pass-rush

**Definition** (STRAIN). $\text{ }$ Let $(x_{ijt}, y_{ijt})$ be the $(x, y)$ location on the field of player $j = 1, \cdots, J$ at frame $t = 1, \cdots, T_i$ for play $i = 1, \cdots, n$; and $(x^{QB}_{it}, y^{QB}_{it})$ be the $(x, y)$ location of the QB at frame $t$ during play $i$.
* Distance between player $j$ and QB at frame $t$ during play $i$ $$f_{d_{ij}}(t) = \sqrt{(x_{ijt} - x^{QB}_{it})^2 + (y_{ijt} - y^{QB}_{it})^2}$$
* Rate at which player $j$ is moving towards QB at frame $t$ during play
$i$ $$\displaystyle f'_{d_{ij}}(t) = \frac{df_{d_{ij}}(t)}{dt}$$
* STRAIN for player $j$ at frame $t$ during play $i$ $$\text{STRAIN}_{ij}(t) = \frac{-f'_{d_{ij}}(t)}{f_{d_{ij}}(t)}$$

---

## Application to pass-rush (cont'd)

* STRAIN estimate

$$\widehat{\text{STRAIN}}_{ij}(t) = \cfrac{-\cfrac{f_{d_{ij}}(t) - f_{d_{ij}}(t - 1)}{0.1}}{f_{d_{ij}}(t)} \,.$$

* Let's break it down...

---

## Advantages of STRAIN

*   Simple

*   Interpretable

*   Derived from a well-established concept from another field

*   Continuous-time within-play metric

---

## Data prep

*   Frames between snap and pass forward/QB sack

*   Remove plays with multiple QBs (e.g. no Taysom Hill)

*   PFF scouting data, "Pass rush" role

## Example play

```{r, out.width="95%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("sack.gif")
```

```{r, out.width="81%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qntkhvn/strain/main/figures/example_play.gif")
```

## Positional STRAIN curves

```{r, out.width="80%"}

```

## Ranking the best pass rushers

```

## Future directions

-   What about pass-blocking?

    -   Rusher-to-blockers matching
    
    -   https://www.kaggle.com/code/fluberson/blocking-is-a-drag

-   "Meta-metrics" ([Franks, D'Amour, Cervone & Bornn (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1515/jqas-2016-0098))
    
    -   Discrimination: Does the metric reliably differentiate between players?

    -   Stability: Does the metric measure a quantity that is stable over time?

    -   Independence: Does the metric provide new information?
    
-   Correlate STRAIN with previously-established metrics

-   Show if STRAIN relates to EPA, completion probability, etc.

## Future directions

-   Other concepts in materials science/physics

    -   Stress: force over an area
    
    -   Elastic modulus: ratio of stress and strain, measures the resitance of an object (the POCKET) to being deformed elastically
